v0.0 (03/09/19):
	Features:
		*> You can move pieces by clicking on them and then clicking the destination square.
		*> The engine will notify you of illegal moves.
		> The engine supports variable depth of search. It is set to 4 by default.
		> The program evaluates positions based on the total value of material.

		* -> Under development

	> To run this program, you will need to have pygame installed.
	> The program is still under development and the code has to be refactored. It has not been extensively tested and is thus error-prone.
	> About the engine:
		> It is not yet efficient enough, leading to relatively long(~50 seconds at search depth 4) wait times.
		> The engine does not support castlings/en-passant captures.
		> While it will try to avoid checks, it is not yet guaranteed that it will always play legal moves.
		> It is not yet aware of a check-mate.
		> It is not aware of any openings, so it is likely that in the beginning it won't try to develop its pieces.
		
v0.1 (12/09/19):
	New features:
		> The python code has been refactored.
		*> The moves predicted by the engine are now stored in a "move buffer", so the engine won't need to run again if you play what it predicted.
		> Fixed the issue of the application window not responding while the engine was running.
		> When the square a piece is to move to has been selected, it is highlighted in yellow.
		> Miscellaneous bug fixes/performance improvements.
		
		* -> Under development
