v0.0 (03/09/19):
	Features:
		*> You can move pieces by clicking on them and then clicking the destination square.
		*> The engine will notify you of illegal moves.
		> The engine supports variable depth of search. It is set to 4 by default.
		> The program evaluates positions based on the total value of material.

		* -> Under development

	> To run this program, you will need to have pygame installed.
	> The program is still under development and the code has to be refactored. It has not been extensively tested and is thus error-prone.
	> About the engine:
		> It is not yet efficient enough.
		> The engine does not support castlings/en-passant captures.
		> While it will try to avoid checks, it is not yet guaranteed that it will always play legal moves.
		> It is not aware of any openings, so it is likely that in the beginning it won't try to develop its pieces.
